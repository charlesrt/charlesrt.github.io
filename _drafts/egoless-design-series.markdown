# Egoless design series

## Research with users

Designing in government comes with a luxury that not all designers get to experience---we conduct research with real users. 

All good designers want to prove their assumptions through validation with real users. Unfortunately, many work in environments where this isn’t an option unless something goes live, and that’s only if they’ve managed to battle the subjective opinion of their peers, marketing, IT and the HiPPOs (highest paid persons opinion) on the committee in meeting after meeting.

Working in an environment like that has it’s own challenges when it comes to design reviews, or more often **crits**, and designers don’t have the luxury of user research to backup their solution.

So---when we work in an environment that not only budgets for user research, but commends it as the highest principal to adhere to, we shouldn’t take that for granted by thinking we know best. We should be better than that.


## Service assessments

Sadly it’s still happening, months later in conversations about service assessments. The controversial opinion is that interactions and “visual treatment” are not the same as they are on other government services. But---that’s OK. That’s a question that should be asked as part of the assessment. 

We have assessments at key stages during a project lifecycle to measure the teams progress against a list of guiding principals. Like the deep dives, they help the team get an external view on what’s going well and what may need changing. However---like the audience in the deep dives, it’s the approach of the assessor that is probably more important than the assessment itself. 

Services should be assessed/reviewed based on how well they work for their users, not critiqued/criticised based on subjective opinion. Assessors should ask open questions to learn more, and they may make recommendations off the back for the team to take away and explore further.

Assessors should **not** have a subjectively predetermined agenda to know a good reason why a service has done something differently. *It’s probably an introvert vs extrovert thing, but that’s a story for another time.*

Services are designed and built at different times and at different paces. It’s not right to assume they should all be the same. The users aren’t the same. Plus it’s good to experiment and try something new. That’s how we learn.

## Being consistent, not uniform

Part of the problem is born from the misused application of design patterns.

Right now, it seems like everyone is talking about patterns, but not everyone is talking about them consistently. 

Patterns are the collaborative design work we all do that make consistently repeatable solutions to common problems. Patterns should not be treated as regimented rules. 

Being consistent is about being adaptable, with recognisable similarities that are relevant to the situation, whereas uniform is inflexible, not tailored and shoe horned.

Good patterns are,

> a solution to a recurring design problem, such that you could use the solution many times and never use it in the same way twice. ---<cite>Modular Web Design, Nathan Curtis</cite>

When discussing the use of patterns we should do so with this in mind and not mandate their application in a particular fashion because we think we know best.

Patterns---like everything---may need to adapt and evolve to fit the context. They should iterate over time as we experiment and learn something new.

*As a bit of a footnote, I wasn’t sure what the title of this story should be. I played with a few options before settling on Egoless design, but at the end of the day it could just as easily have been any of these:*

- Objective design
- Altruistic design
- Principal design

Or simply, **Good design**.
